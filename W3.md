Dormer conducts an audibility test of the fire alarm inside occupied residential units. The audibility test showed the alarm could not be heard within all of the residential units, which is in violation of the local fire code. The problem with the alarm may have existed since the time the building was constructed or when the fire alarm system was replaced in 1988.**

**Dormer advises Clause Enterprises regarding the results of the audibility tests and the code violation.

Dormer is paid for his services, but reminds Clause Enterprises that the alarms are not audible in some units which could lead to a dangerous situation should a fire occur.**
