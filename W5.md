**John Jackson (an engineer, and a bonsai specialist) has a contract with Smith Landscaping to design and build a retaining wall on a ocean view property located on Quadra Island. John had completed the wall, and now was contracted to arrange large bonsai trees (carefully nurtured by John over the last 20+ years) on to the property by June 30th, 2023. John (and his trees) arrive to the island via boat on the morning of June 30th, and the trees (worth $30,000 each) were loaded onto a five ton flat deck truck. John jumps into the front seat of the truck, and the driver, himself and the trees proceed along a gravel road to the ocean view property. The installation of these trees was the final step in beautifying the property in order to get it ready for a large July 1st party the following day. Along the journey, a culvert was washed out (from a storm the night before) and John is unable to get to the property to install the trees.**

This is may be Force Majeure, which would forgive John's inability to perform as per his contract. He is not found liable and the job was rescheduled for the following morning.**
